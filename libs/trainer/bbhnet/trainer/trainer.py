            Module

            An Iterable of (X, y) pairs where X is a batch of training

            An Iterable of (X, y) pairs where X is a batch of training
            data and y is the corresponding targets
        max_epochs:
            Maximum number of epochs over which to train.
        init_weights:
            Path to weights with which to initialize network. If
            left as `None`, network will be randomly initialized.
            If `init_weights` is a directory, it will be assumed
            that this directory contains a file called `weights.pt`.
        lr:
            Learning rate to use during training.
        weight_decay:
            Amount of regularization to apply during training.
        patience:
            Number of epochs without improvement in validation
            loss before learning rate is reduced. If left as
            `None`, learning rate won't be scheduled. Ignored

            Factor by which to reduce the learning rate after

            if `valid_data is None`.
        device:
            Indicating which device (i.e. cpu or gpu) to run on. Use
            `"cuda"` to use the default GPU available, or `"cuda:{i}`"`,
            where `i` is a valid GPU index on your machine, to specify
            a specific GPU (alternatively, consider setting the environment
            variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${i}` and using just `"cuda"`
            here).
        profile:
            Whether to generate a tensorboard profile of the
            training step on the first epoch. This will make
            this first epoch slower.
