    Generates the waveforms for a single segment.

    Args:
        start:
            GPS time of the beginning of the testing segment
        end:
            GPS time of the end of the testing segment
        ifos:
            List of interferometers to query data from. Expected to be given
            by prefix; e.g. "H1" for Hanford. Should be the same length as
            `shifts`
        shifts:
            The length of time in seconds by which each interferometer's
            timeseries will be shifted
        background_dir:
            Directory containing background data to use for PSD
            calculation. Should have data for each interferometer in
            the format generated by `background.py`
        spacing:
            The amount of time, in seconds, to leave between the end
            of one signal and the start of the next
        buffer:
            The amount of time, in seconds, on either side of the
            segment within which injection times will not be
            generated
        prior:
            A function that returns a Bilby PriorDict when called
        minimum_frequency:
            Minimum frequency of the gravitational wave. The part
            of the gravitational wave at lower frequencies will
            not be generated. Specified in Hz.
        reference_frequency:
            Frequency of the gravitational wave at the state of
            the merger that other quantities are defined with
            reference to
        sample_rate:
            Sample rate of timeseries data, specified in Hz
        waveform_duration:
            Duration of waveform in seconds
        waveform_approximant:
            Name of the waveform approximant to use.
        coalescence_time:
            Location of the defining point of the signal within
            the generated waveform
        highpass:
            The frequency to use for a highpass filter, specified
            in Hz
        snr_threshold:
            Minimum SNR of generated waveforms. Sampled parameters
            that result in an SNR below this threshold will be rejected,
            but saved for later use
        output_dir:
            Directory to which the waveform file and rejected parameter
            file will be written
        log_file:
            File containing the logged information
        verbose:
            If True, log at `DEBUG` verbosity, otherwise log at
            `INFO` verbosity.

    Returns:
        The name of the waveform file and the name of the file containing the
        rejected parameters
