    for streaming inference, including adding a model
    for caching input snapshot state on the server.

    Args:
        weights:
            File Like object or Path representing
            a set of trained weights that will be
            exported to a model_repository. Supports
            local and S3 paths.

            configs

            Path to file containing a batch of data from model
            training. This is used to determine the input size
            of the model. File structure is assumed to match
            the structure of the file written during training
        logdir:
            Directory to which logs will be written

            Length of segment in seconds that the network sees
        inference_sampling_rate:
            The rate at which kernels are sampled from the
            h(t) timeseries. This, along with the `sample_rate`,
            dictates the size of the update expected at the
            snapshotter model
        sample_rate:
            Rate at which the input kernel has been sampled, in Hz
        batch_size:
            Number of kernels per batch
        fduration:
            Length of the time-domain whitening filter in seconds
        psd_length:
            Length of background time in seconds to use for PSD
            calculation
        fftlength:
            Length of time in seconds to use to calculate the FFT
            during whitening
        highpass:
            Frequency to use for a highpass filter
        streams_per_gpu:
            The number of snapshot states to host per GPU during
            inference
        aframe_instances:
            The number of concurrent execution instances of the
            aframe architecture to host per GPU during inference
        platform:
            The backend framework platform used to host the
