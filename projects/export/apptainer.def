# installing the local package editably via pip
# works, but none of the dependencies (e.g. ml4gw)
# are installed editably, so we'll opt for using
# the full poetry machinery without using a
# virtual environment. Note that this can potentially
# cause issues if the poetry install makes changes to
# the virtualenv package in the base environment, so
# we'll hard pin it to the value we need.
# TODO: there's got to be a better solution here

# hard code cuda version in container to 11.8.
# tenssorrt 8.5.1.7 is not compatible with cuda > 12.0,
# which is the default on dgx boxes. Sadly, tensorrt 8.6.1 
# is currently incompatible with poetry for some reason
# see this issue https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/issues/3362.
# once (if) that gets resolved, the more robust fix should be to
# just upgrade tensorrt
