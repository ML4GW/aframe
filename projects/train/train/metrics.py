    """
    Metric that computes the area under the ROC curve (AUROC)
    using timeslides. AUROC is a less than ideal metric
    for a lot of reasons, but it's more stable than just
    computing the recall at a fixed FAR since it effectively
    averages your recall over many thresholds. To compensate
    for the fact that we don't care about our performance at
    higher FPRs, we only measure the AUROC up to a fixed
    false alarm rate.

    Simulates test-time scenario by pooling background
    events from within a given timeslide. For this reason,
    metric is iteratively updated with both foreground
    and background predictions, as well as an index indicating
    the shift the predictions were made on.

    Torch metrics handles aggregating the predictions from
    multiple workers on the backend, so this is automatically
    compatible with distributed evaluation. The only trick is
    making sure that your timeslides get split up among your
    devices.
